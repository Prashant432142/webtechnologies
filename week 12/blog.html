            <p><h1>Week-11:Reflective Writing</h1>
                We learned so much within these eleven weeks of learning in college as I have been attentively doing all my works given to me by my teachers and have been a obedient student. The courses are tough to carry on but with the help and guidance our teachers have provided to us, the burden of heavy researches are minimized. Periodically, over each week passes by, I have been having a habit of researching resources which I know will help me a lot in finding necessary helps in near future. Web technology has been taking all my sanity and patience but in terms of study, it is the most interesting topic as we work with GUI interface within a programming which directly visualizes the amount of effort we put onto.</p>
